                <h3><b>Electrical Engineering </b> is the design, building and maintenance of electrical control systems, machinery and equipment. Some electrical engineering concerns are also found in mechanical and civil engineering.

The term electrical engineering often includes electronics engineering. While electrical engineers mainly focus on large-scale production and distribution of electrical power, electronics engineers are concerned with smaller electronic circuits and often also work with computers and other modern technologies. However, any undergraduate course will include elements of both electrical and electronics engineering.
                    
        A lot of electrical engineering undergraduate degrees will include elements of electronics engineering too. Overall, you will develop analytical, technical and engineering design skills.

First year courses usually overlap across all engineering degrees usually including mathematics, communications engineering and signals, engineering principles, systems and communications and laboratory and presentation skills.
