                <h3><b>Computer Science Engineering</b> encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware.

Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics. In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering departments and in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field. The computer science experience will give ample knowledge about the implementation design and management of the entire information system in both the aspects- hardware as well as software. This is a course which is offered all over the globe in the best of the technical institutions and a student can do graduation as well as post-graduation degrees.</h3>
